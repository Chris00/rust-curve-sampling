Curve Sampling
==============

This module provide a collection of routines to perform adaptive
sampling of curves as well as manipulating those samplings.


Example
-------

Here is a graph of the function x ↦ x sin(1/x) produced with only 227
evaluations (to match a depth 5 recursion for Mathematica).
